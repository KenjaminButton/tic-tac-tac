## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
* A text editor if you want to modify the code (VS Code recommended)
* Node.js and npm for running tests

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KenjaminButton/tic-tac-tac.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd tic-tac-tac
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Run tests
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
5. Open index.html in your web browser
   ```sh
   open index.html
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the game in your web browser
2. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their X or O
3. The game will automatically detect wins or draws
4. Click the reset button to start a new game

## Testing

The project uses Jest for comprehensive testing of all game functionality. The test suite covers:

### Game Setup Tests
- Player name validation
- Symbol (X/O) selection
- Game board initialization
- Initial state verification

### Game Mechanics Tests
- Valid move placement
- Invalid move prevention
- Computer move generation
- Turn alternation
- Board state management

### Win Detection Tests
- Horizontal win patterns
- Vertical win patterns
- Diagonal win patterns
- Draw game scenarios
- Win celebration triggers

### Score Tracking Tests
- Player score increments
- Computer score increments
- Draw count tracking
- Score persistence after reset

### Event Handler Tests
- DOM event listener initialization
- Player input handling
- Game board click responses
- Reset button functionality

### Running Tests
```sh
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch
```

All tests are located in `script.test.js` and use Jest's testing environment with jsdom for DOM manipulation.
